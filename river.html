		<h1 class="a1">GREEN RIVER KILLER</h1>
		<div class="b1"><img src="images/grk1.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a2"><p>Gary Leon Ridgway (born February 18, 1949), also known as the Green River Killer, is an American serial killer. He was initially convicted of 48 separate murders. As part of his plea bargain, another conviction was added, bringing the total number of convictions to 49, making him the second most prolific serial killer in United States history according to confirmed murders.He killed many teenage girls and women in the state of Washington during the 1980s and 1990s.Most of Ridgway's victims were alleged to be sex workers and other women in vulnerable circumstances, including underage runaways. The press gave him his nickname after the first five victims were found in the Green River before his identity was known.He strangled his victims, usually by hand but sometimes using ligatures. After strangling them, he would dump their bodies in forested and overgrown areas in King County, often returning to the bodies to have sexual intercourse with them.</p></div>
		<div class="b2"><img src="images/grk6.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a3"><p>Ridgway was dyslexic, and was held back a year in high school.When he was 16, he stabbed a six-year-old boy who survived the attack. Ridgway had led the boy into the woods and then stabbed him through the ribs into his liver.According to women in his life, Ridgway had an insatiable sexual appetite. His three ex-wives and several ex-girlfriends reported that he demanded sex from them several times a day.Often, he would want to have sex in a public area or in the woods.Ridgway himself admitted to having a fixation with sex workers,with whom he had a love/hate relationship. He frequently complained about their presence in his neighborhood, but he also took advantage of their services regularly. Some have speculated that Ridgway was torn between his lusts and his staunch religious beliefs.</p></div>
		<div class="b3"><img src="images/grk4.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a4"><p>Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Ridgway is believed to have murdered at least 71 teenage girls and women near Seattle and Tacoma, Washington. In court statements, he later reported that he had killed so many that he lost count.He killed most victims in his home, his truck, or a secluded area.Most of their bodies were dumped in wooded areas around the Green River, Seattle–Tacoma International Airport, and other "dump sites" within South King County.</p></div>
		<div class="b4"><img src="images/grk5.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a5"><p>Ridgway was arrested in 1982 and 2001 on charges related to prostitution.He became a suspect in the Green River killings in 1983.In 1984, Ridgway passed a polygraph test.On April 7, 1987, police took hair and saliva samples from Ridgway.The samples collected in 1987 were later subjected to a DNA analysis, providing the evidence for his arrest warrant.On November 30, 2001, Ridgway was at the Kenworth truck factory, where he worked as a spray painter, when police arrived to arrest him. Ridgway was arrested on suspicion of murdering four women nearly 20 years earlier after first being identified as a potential suspect, when DNA evidence conclusively linked semen left in the victims to the saliva swab taken by the police. The four victims named in the original indictment were Marcia Chapman, Opal Mills, Cynthia Hinds, and Carol Ann Christensen. Three more victims — Wendy Coffield, Debra Bonner, and Debra Estes — were added to the indictment after a forensic scientist identified microscopic spray paint spheres as a specific brand and composition of paint used at the Kenworth factory during the specific time frame when these victims were killed.</p></div>
		<div class="b5"><img src="images/grk3.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a6"><p>Ridgway confessed to more confirmed murders than any other American serial killer. Over a period of five months of police and prosecutor interviews, he confessed to 48 murders — 42 of which were on the police's list of probable Green River Killer victims.On February 9, 2004, county prosecutors began to release the videotape records of Ridgway's confessions. In one taped interview, he initially told investigators that he was responsible for the deaths of 65 women.In another taped interview with Reichert on December 31, 2003, Ridgway claimed to have murdered 71 victims and confessed to having had sex with them before killing them, a detail which he did not reveal until after his sentencing.</p></div>
		<div class="b6"><img src="images/grk2.jpg"></div>
		<div class="a7"><p>In his confession, he acknowledged that he targeted prostitutes because they were "easy to pick up" and that he "hated most of them."He confessed that he had sex with his victims' bodies after he murdered them, but claimed he began burying the later victims so that he could resist the urge to commit necrophilia.Ridgway later said that murdering young women was his "career."Ridgway was placed in solitary confinement at Washington State Penitentiary in Walla Walla in January 2004.</p></div>
		<div class="a8">
			<p>But afterall some questions still remain unanswered...(MindHunting Questions)</p>
			<p>1. Why did he felt both lust and hate towards his victims????</p>
			<p>2. What type of experiences did he faced as a child that he committed such type of murders???</p>
			<p>3. How people like him seem to be normal but do things like these???</p>
